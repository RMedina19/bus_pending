## You don't see any data?
If this is the only file on this folder, you may generate the bus data either by running the scrapper (see [README](https://github.com/RMedina19/bus_pending/blob/scraping/README.md)) or by downloading it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e97aufUhLLLAIf2sp-jjQ__-gJ13n83f/view) and storing it in this folder. 

If you download the data, remember to rename the file to `buses.db` for the `bus_pending` module to succesfully run.
